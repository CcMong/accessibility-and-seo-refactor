    <!--HERO IMAGE: This div element below is purely for styling the background image.
        No content within the div, so no need to put a span element within the div to style the image directly.
        - 'hero' as a class name is not descriptive enough. So changed to 'hero-image'.
        - Role of div element specified as 'img'
        - Alt attributes cannot be added to background images. So used an aria-label instead for accessibility.

        - Also changed the child div elements to section elements.
        - Then I created the 'main-content' class to consolidate the classes within the 3 child elements
        - Added alt atttibutes to all three images

        - The div element with 'benefits' class changed to an aside element. 
        - All children div elements changed to section elements with the benefit-all class.
        - The benefit-all class consolidated and replaced the previous benefit-lead/brand/cost classes.
        - Alt attributes added to all image elements. Took out the Cost Management closing img tag
